Berg:

- steady_state option
	- Add a steady-state option to enable the user passing a file containing a 
steady-state configuration of the solution
	- Build a function to initialize the initial conditions using this file
	- Build a function to write the steady-state to a file

- monodomain
	- Add a variable diameter on the monodomain equation (check my master's writeups ...)

- models_library
	- Fix bug on the Noble 1962 Purkinje cell model
	- Fix bug on the Li & Rudy 2011 Purkinje cell model
	- Build more celular model related to Purkinje cell (DiFrancesco Noble, ...)
	- Test each variation of the TenTusscher model (Miocardium, Epicardium and Endocardium) using the 2006 version.
	- Refactor the code of the 'mask_function' module
	- Made more tests with the adaptive mesh when dealing with more than one celular model

- extras
	- Ask Sachetto for the "big_scar", "small_scar" and "human" ALG meshes files.
	- Decide if the metric of the Purkinje should be in centimeters or in micrometers.

========================================================================================================================================
Sachetto:

- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Finish GUI interface
